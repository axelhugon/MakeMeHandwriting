# MakeMeHandwriting
MakeMeHandwriting is a simple iOS App (using SWIFT 3 and handwriting.io API) to make your typed text handwritten. The user will retrieve an image (PNG or PDF) that he can share by email, sms or share via social networks.

## Features
* Validation user's input
* Preview font
* Choose font and color
* Loading while processing
* Handwrited text render as a PNG Image
* CocoaPods to manage dependencies
The user can choose the font (with a preview) and the color of the handwriting text.

## Usage
Download the files and open the .xcworkspace file (not .xcodeproj, because of pod).

## Dependencies
Dependencies are managed by CocoaPods. This project uses the following:
* Alamofire HTTP Networking
* SwiftValidator to validate user's inputs
* SDWebImage : To provide an async image downloader with cache support
* SwiftyJSON : To deal easily with JSON data in Swift.
